# Problem statement:

Your objective is to assess financial data to project future cash flows, calculate their current value, estimate the company's worth at a future point,
and determine the present value of both future cash flows and the company's future worth to establish its overall valuation.

# Overview:

* Forecasting Cash Flows:
Initiate by projecting free cash flows. Develop revenue projections, a fixed assets schedule, and a net working capital projection to establish future cash flow estimates.
* Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) Computation:
Calculate the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) to discount all future cash flows back to their present value. This step is crucial for valuation.
* Terminal Value Determination:
Compute the terminal value, representing the company's worth beyond the forecast period. This value is a critical component in the valuation process.
* Enterprise Value Calculation:
Discount both the terminal value and the forecasted free cash flows to ascertain the enterprise value, using which calculate the valuation of the company.
